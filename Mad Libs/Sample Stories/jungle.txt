The {animal} and the {food}

Once upon a time, deep in an ancient jungle,             
there lived a {animal}.  This {animal}                   
liked to eat {food}, but the jungle had                  
very little {food} to offer.  One day, an              
explorer found the {animal} and discovered              
it liked {food}.  The explorer took the                 
{animal} back to {city}, where it could                 
eat as much {food} as it wanted.  However,              
the {animal} became homesick, so the                    
explorer brought it back to the jungle,                 
leaving behind all the {food}.                       
                                                        
The End
